Imagine you have call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and director.
An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. if the 
respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the
manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director
Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchcall() which
assigns a call to the first avaliable employee.
